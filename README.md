Here is a list of them:

## Doodle<br>
Casual Doodle game. 
Your hero automatically jumps from platform to platform 
to go higher - you control whether he jumps right or left. 
Platforms do not move. They are not evenly spaced, 
so you must move the Doodler by pressing A or D to the left or right respectively
as he jumps. If you miss a platform and there isn't one below to land on, you'll go into freefall 
and end the game. If you move Doodler far enough to one side,
the Doodler will leave the screen and return on the other side
